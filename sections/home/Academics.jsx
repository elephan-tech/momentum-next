              Targeted Learning to Student Needs Each Monument Academy student engages in a targeted learning journey that is rooted in data driven instruction as evidenced by triangulation of MAP data, quarterly assessments, and PARCC data. We seek to develop self-directed learners by engaging students in academic goal setting during student led conferences, and structuring an environment that provides options for how students access content, practice new skills, and demonstrate mastery of the standards using technology and research.
